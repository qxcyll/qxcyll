 </h3>

<div>

I’m a student of `Systems Analysis and Development` at the `UNNIASELVI`.  
My journey in technology started: at the age of 18.</br>
At 19, I discovered my creative side, which also fueled my passion for interfaces and visual aesthetics.

When I turned 21 and entered college, I fully dove into programming.  
Since then, I have been dedicating my time to studying development in depth, with a special focus on `Fullstack Web Development`.  
Although I study the complete ecosystem, my real strength and the area I enjoy exploring the most is `Front-End`, where I can combine logic, creativity, and design.
