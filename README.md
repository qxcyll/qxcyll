<h1>Gabriel M.</h1>
	
I’m a student of `Systems Analysis and Development` at the `UNNIASELVI`.  
My journey in technology started: at the age of 18.
At 19, I discovered my creative side, which also fueled my passion for interfaces and visual aesthetics.
When I turned 21 and entered college, I fully dove into programming.  
Since then, I have been dedicating my time to studying development in depth, with a special focus on `Fullstack Web Development`.
